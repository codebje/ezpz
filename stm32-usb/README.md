# USB driver for eZ-pZ

## Design notes

Virtual COM port activity is entirely interrupt driven: USB data is sent to UARTs, UART data is sent to USB. Nothing happens unless an interrupt makes it happen.

ZDI activity is more stateful and will constitute the main execution loop of the firmware: wait for user input (constructed via USB ISRs), process one command at a time.

Each CDC function has one CIC interface with one Interrupt IN endpoint, and one CDC interface with paired Bulk IN and OUT endpoints. The STM32L073 has eight IN endpoints and eight OUT endpoints; one IN endpoint is reserved for the control endpoint.

| Endpoint      | IN            | OUT           |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| EP0           | Control       | Control       |
| EP1           | UART0 CDC     | UART0 CDC     |
| EP2           | UART0 CIC     |               |
| EP3           | UART1 CDC     | UART1 CDC     |
| EP4           | UART1 CIC     |               |
| EP5           | UART2 CDC     | UART2 CDC     |
| EP6           | UART2 CIC     |               |
| EP7           |               |               |

There's a 1024-byte buffer available, to be shared between a 64-byte buffer descriptor table and the buffers for received and transmitted data. The control endpoints are fixed at 64 bytes of data in `usb_desc.c:USBD_FS_DeviceDesc[]` and appear to be restricted to being exactly 64 bytes for fullspeed devices. The BTABLE address is set to 0000h by the low level HAL driver.

### Modules

  - `Core`
      - `main.c` calls out to initialise peripherals, then enters the main loop. Currently this does nothing: eventually it will run the ZDI interactions
      - `stm32l0xx_it.c` invokes the USB peripheral controller driver (PCD) via `USB_IRQHandler()`
      - Other files configure peripherals or provide necessary stubs and are unmodified
  - `USB`
      - `usbd_conf.c` has the callbacks invoked by the HAL PCD code, and some bindings between Low-Level and PCD
      - `usbd_core.c` connects a `USBD_ClassTypeDef` to the ISR callbacks
      - `usbd_desc.c` contains the device descriptor, strings, VID, and PID
      - `usbd_ctlreq.c` handles Setup requests that are not Class/Vendor specific
      - `usbd_ioreq.c` sends and receives on the control endpoint
      - `usbd_cdc.c` implements the CDC device class
      - `usbd_cdc_if.c` has an implementation of a CDC interface
      - `usb_device.c` initialises the USB device

### USB call tree

  - `stm32l0xx_it.c:USB_IRQHandler()` is invoked by hardware
      - `stm32l0xx_hal_pcd.c:HAL_PCD_IRQHandler()` checks `USB_ISTR` status register
          - If `USB_ISTR_CTR` is set, indicating an endpoint has completed a transfer:
              - `stm32l0xx_hal_pcd.c:PCD_EP_ISR_Handler()` - endpoint handler
                  - `usbd_conf.c:HAL_PCD_SetupStageCallback()` on SETUP
                      - `usbd_core.c:USBD_LL_SetupStage()`
                          - `usbd_ctlreq.c:USBD_StdDevReq()` on recipient DEVICE
                              - `usbd_cdc.c:USBD_CDC->Setup()` on type CLASS or VENDOR
                          - `usbd_ctlreq.c:USBD_StdItfReq()` on recipient INTERFACE
                              - `usbd_cdc.c:USBD_CDC->Setup()` on type CLASS, VENDOR, or STANDARD
                          - `usbd_ctlreq.c:USBD_StdEPReq()` on recipient ENDPOINT
                  - `usbd_conf.c:HAL_PCD_DataOutStageCallback()` on OUT
                      - `usbd_core.c:USBD_LL_DataOutStage()`
                  - `usbd_conf.c:HAL_PCD_DataInStageCallback()' on IN
                      - `usbd_core.c:USBD_LL_DataInStage()`
          - If `USB_ISTR_RESET` is set:
              - `usbd_conf.c:HAL_PCD_ResetCallback()`
                  - `usbd_core.c:USBD_LL_SetSpeed(USBD_SPEED_FULL)`
                  - `usbd_core.c:USBD_LL_Reset()`
                      - `usbd_conf.c:USBD_LL_OpenEP()`
                          - `stm32l0xx_hal_pcd.c:HAL_PCD_EP_Open()` for EP0 OUT
                          - `stm32l0xx_hal_pcd.c:HAL_PCD_EP_Open()` for EP0 IN
                          - Calls `DeInit` from `usbd_cdc.c:USBD_CDC`, which is `usbd_cdc.c:USBD_CDC_DeInit()`
                              - `stm32l0xx_hal_pcd.c:USBD_LL_CloseEP()` for `CDC_IN_EP`
                              - `stm32l0xx_hal_pcd.c:USBD_LL_CloseEP()` for `CDC_OUT_EP`
                              - `stm32l0xx_hal_pcd.c:USBD_LL_CloseEP()` for `CDC_CMD_EP`
                              - Calls `DeInit` from `usbd_cdc_if.c:USBD_Interface_fops_FS`
                              - Frees the class data
              - `stm32l0xx_hal_pcd.c:HAL_PCD_SetAddress()` to 0
          - If `USB_ISTR_WKUP` is set:
              - `stm32l0xx_hal_pcd_ex.c:HAL_PCDEx_LPM_Callback()` if `LPM_State` is `LPM_L1`
                  - `__weak` stub, does nothing
              - `usbd_conf.c:HAL_PCD_ResumeCallback()`
                  - If low power mode is enabled, clears sleep on exit bit
                  - `usbd_core.c:USBD_LL_Resume()` sets state to what it was before suspend
          - If `USB_ISTR_SUSP` is set:
              - `usbd_conf.c:HAL_PCD_SuspendCallback()`
                  - `usbd_core.c:USBD_LL_Suspend()` sets state to suspended
                  - If low power mode is enabled, puts ÂµC to sleep on exit from ISR
          - If `USB_ISTR_L1REQ` is set:
              - `stm32l0xx_hal_pcd_ex.c:HAL_PCDEx_LPM_Callback()` if `LPM_State` is `LPM_L0`
              - `usbd_conf.c:HAL_PCD_SuspendCallback()` otherwise
          - If `USB_ISTR_SOF` is set:
              - `usbd_conf.c:HAL_PCD_SOFCallback()`
                  - `usbd_core.c:USBD_LL_SOF()`
                      - Looks up class callback in `usbd_cdc.c:USBD_CDC`, which is `NULL`

## Issues

  - `stm32l0xx_hal_pcd.c:HAL_PCD_IRQHandler()` clears `USB_ISTR` flags erroneously by using a read-modify-write sequence.
  - `usbd_ctlreq.c:USBD_StdEPReq()` checks for CLASS requests twice. Only effect is mildly reduced efficiency.

## Follow-ups

  - What `EP_TYPE` is set by the template CDC code? 
  - How is the buffer descriptor table assembled? By calling `HAL_PCD_EP_Open()`, after having configured the endpoint in `usbd_conf.c:USBD_LL_Init()`.

## Changes made

  1. The STM32L073 only supports USB Full Speed. There's code to support some parts of High Speed, but they're unreachable. Removing the high speed and other-speed configuration descriptors and associated callbacks and invocations reduces code complexity.
  2. Change `usbd_desc.c:USBD_FS_DeviceDesc[]` to the Composite class.
